## SUMMARY

In my third project, I worked in a four person group project where our product was a social music event app designed for people to chat within groups attending upcoming gigs. Our application used a MEAN stack and combined three external APIâ€™s, pulling event information from Ticketmaster, playing relevant songs from Spotify and displaying the location for each event using Google Maps. The idea was that users would use the site to help plan their night using Google Map features as well as being a tool for people to recommend the artist's songs to others before the gig.

This was my first opportunity to working in team environment and it highlighted the importance of using project management tools such as Trello to keep the team aligned and informed of agile sprints. Features within the app were shared between the team and I was responsible for implementing and running the back end testing using Mocha and Chai. I also built the comments functionality and styled the section using a combination of Bulma and SASS.

## PLANNING

### Ideas Mapping & Group Planning
After being allocated into teams, we all went away to try to come up with idea for our group website. The next day we pitched our own ideas to each other until we settled on the social music sharing and event app. This was a theme I was particularly happy with as I've always wanted this exact type of app to exist for gigs or festivals that I go to.

Below are some initial wireframe sketches my team and I made when thinking about the flow of the website and the user's journey when navigating between pages.

### Trello Planning
Throughout the project, our team maintained a Trello board to help plan and track everyone's daily tasks. This was the first time I had used Trello within a group environment and I found being able to assign tasks to individual members was a great feature. Often during the project week, we would all be working on our own individual feautres and the Trello board made it much easier to see where we were as a team and what was due next. I found that when we were planning there seemed to be a fine balace between planning individual sprint in details and not being bogged down with too much detail, especially as we were all novice coders. As none of us had a full understanding of how long each task would take, it would not have been useful to plan things by the hour.

### Wireframing and Prototyping
Once our team had a firm idea of our plan, what our site was about and the sort of features we wanted to include, we set about wireframing the pages using [Proto.io](https://proto.io/). This was the first time I had come across prototyping software and I found it incredibly useful to help visualise how someone would navigate around final website. As we had all agreed in the design and layout of the site at an early stage, it was also useful later on down the line during the styling phase.

## FINAL APP
### Screenshots
Below are screenshots showing the final layout of our website. We decided to try to emulate the simple clean layout that you can find on the Spotify desktop app.

### OAuth
On the initial login page, a user can choose to register their details and set up a login. However to get the Spotify functionality working on Event pages, a user can login with their Spotify account details.

The modal below appears once the users opts to login using their Spotify login:

![oauth](./src/images/readme/screenshot_spotifyOauth.png)
> Figure 8 - Spotify login modal

The OAuth functionality is handled within a controller in the back end. Here, request-promise is used to send `POST` request to Spotify. Parameters such as the unique Spotify secret ID are included in the headers. Once the ID is authorised by Spotify,`request-promise` then handles a `GET` request which includes the encoded `access_token` from Spotify. This is stored in Local Storage within the browser and the tool that lets the website know that the user is authorised.

```js
function spotifyLogin(req, res, next) {

...

  var headers = {
    Authorization:
      'Basic ' +
      new Buffer(req.body.clientId + ':' + oauth.SPOTIFY_SECRET).toString(
        'base64'
      )
  };
  
...

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    rp({
      method: 'post',
      uri: tokenUrl,
      json: true,
      form: params,
      headers: headers
    })
      .then(body => {
        req.spotifyToken = body.access_token;

        return rp({
          method: 'GET',
          uri: userUrl,
          json: true,
          headers: {
            Authorization: 'Bearer ' + body.access_token
          }
        });
      })
```

### Proxy Request
In order to get event data back from the Ticketmaster API, we needed once again use `request-promise` to retrieve and handle operations in the back end.

Once we had registered our application on the ticketmaster developer [site](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/), we looked through the available documentation to work out how and what data we would need. According to the documentation, a series of query string just need to be added to the root URL to help define the data being requested. 

```js
function getEventData(req, res) {
  rp('https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json?countryCode=GB&classificationName=pop&classificationName=concertp&city=London&sort=date,asc&apikey=bbr8L0veZB9V45s6JSAf321OGwHhydvq')
    
...

}
```
The URL above had query strings which requested the following information from Ticketmaster:

* classificationName (X2) - Pop music & pop concerts
* city - London
* sort - Sort results by date in ascending order

### Ticketmaster API Data
An example of the JSON data received back from Ticketmaster is below. The information given is quite substantial which made it much easier to pad out our site with text and images. One particularly useful bit on information provided was the `latitude` and `longitude` figures from each event location. We later fed these numbers into the Google Maps API so that we could render a map around the specific location.

## MY RESPONSIBILITIES
This being a group project, we split up the tasks and listed them out on our Trello board. Each of us had invidual responsibilities and some of mine are listed below:

### Google Maps
One of my tasks was to integrate the Google Maps API so it would display the gig locations for individual events. This was done my making a `Custom Directive` which AngularJS allows you to do. Once set up, the directive can be called within the `views` files. The code below shows where the `latitude` and `longitude` figures are injected into the constructor function at the bottom. The reason for the 1000ms `$timeout` is to accomodate for asynchronous way that JavaScript works. Without this `$timeout`, the browser would try to render the map before it receives data and it would just display an error.

```js
function googleMap($window, $timeout) {
  return {
  
	...
	
    },
    link(scope, element) {
      $timeout(renderMap, 1000);
      function renderMap() {
        const latLng = {
          lat: parseFloat(scope.center.lat),
          lng: parseFloat(scope.center.lng)
        };

        map = new $window.google.maps.Map(element[0], {
          zoom: 16,
          center: latLng
        });
```

### Comments Section
I was also responsible for adding functionailty to allow users to leave and delete comments on the groups' show pages.

```js
const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    content: { type: String, required: true },
    createdBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Member', required: true }
  },
  {
    timestamps: true
  }
);

commentSchema.methods.belongsTo = function commentsBelongsTo(member) {
  if (typeof this.createdBy.id === 'string')
    return this.createdBy.id === member.id;
  return member.id === this.createdBy.toString();
};

const groupSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, trim: true, required: true },
 ...
  comments: [commentSchema]
});
```

### Testing

TDD

To run the back end testing, I used Mocha and Chai

![mocha logo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/af4bf83ab2ca125346740f9961345a24ec43b3a9/68747470733a2f2f636c6475702e636f6d2f78465646784f696f41552e737667) ![chai logo](https://seeklogo.com/images/C/chai-logo-F349805F7D-seeklogo.com.png)

## STYLING
### Card Animations
changing on hover

```css
._card {
  background-color: $almost-black;
  border-left: 4px solid $spotify-green;
  color: $white;
  &:hover {
    background-color: darken( $almost-black, 2% );
    border-left: 4px solid #DA22FF;
    cursor: pointer;
    }
```

### Minimal Colour Theme
stick to few colours and maintain through out

```js
// Colors
$spotify-green: #1db954;
$black: black;
$almost-black: #1C1C1C;
$white: white;
```
